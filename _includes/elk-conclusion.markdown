# Conclusion

[Elasticsearch][elasticsearch] has the well deserved reputation of being
blistering fast while ingesting data as well as answering queries of all sorts
and shapes.

It is indeed possible to achieve a truly massive scale of several petabytes of
data, on clusters of hundreds or thousands of nodes, ....

To be able to do this best, you will need a thorough knowledge of both your
business and the technical details of the platform (OS, JVM, Elasticsearch,
...).

This definitely has some challenges and complexities but, however, especially
at a large scale, this is required to make sure you will get the best bang for
your buck and your elasticsearch will stay fast at the right cost.
